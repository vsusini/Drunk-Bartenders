Game is starting to look good fham.


-----THINGS TO FINISH-----

TODO Priority list:

1. get moveToPlayer() function working properly
2. Scroll with movement of player
3. Decide on final character list? Don't like our current one.
4. Finish all player cards
5. Clean up js (its a bit hard to find stuff rn)
6. Sidebar text (HELP button)

FIX Priority list:

1. finding players on moveToPlayer() seems to mess up later in game.

IDEA LIST:

1. save game state using cookies? Could be a nice feature - "Resume last game (y/n)"
2. player thorws dice? lol
3.card idea: drink if you cant rememeber last card, swearing
